            <h3>In the new age of social media, fandoms have evolved what streaming is to music. Before the digital age,
                people didn’t stream music for the chart numbers. If a song were doing good genuinely, it would come out
                on
                top of the charts. With the rise of fandoms and fangirls, there is new pressure on artists to have the
                most
                streams. Whether replaying a YouTube music video or having a strategic way to build streams on Spotify,
                fandoms have found a new way to get their artists recognized. Two popular bands who have redefined the
                way
                of streaming are One Direction and BTS. Directioners and ARMY are two of the largest fandoms in the
                music
                industry and they show love to their favorite artists in many ways. One of the ways is by streaming
                their
                songs to that they will break a record, which is a big accomplishment for the artist. Both fandoms have
                changed what streaming looks like. This website explores the differences between fandoms in streaming
                and
                how they do it</h3>

                        <p>Although both groups have insanely dedicated fandoms, BTS has broken records when it comes to
                            streaming because of how ARMY streams its songs. Streaming has changed so much that
                            Billboard has changed its streaming rules. As of <a href= "https://twitter.com/chartdata/status/1481051433923649538">January 11, 2022</a>, only 1 digital sale will
                            be counted per customer per week for songs and albums. "Bulk purchases" of 2 or more will
                            not be counted.

                <p>Fandoms have come up with a way to stream in order to get a song or album to chart on Billboard. As
                    seen below, ARMY has its own streaming guide.

                <p>Because streaming has changed and fandoms have become more intense, there’s a big gap between the
                    bands’ most streamed songs. For One Direction, it’s Drag Me Down. For BTS, it’s Dynamite.
                </p>
                <li>Drag Me Down: 700 Million</li>

            <div class="text-b">
                <p>There’s a stark difference in YouTube views as well. Each band broke records of its own. For example,
                    One Direction has over 3 billion Youtube views. Two of BTS’s videos have 1 billion views. Combined
                    with the rest of the views on music videos, they have over 3 billion views.

        <p>What’s a successful band without a movie documenting their life? Both groups showed movies showcasing the behind the scenes look of their music and their tour life. When they released both released their albums, fans flocked to movie theaters and treated the movies like the an actual concert. When a sentimental song came on, fans would turn on their flashlights or turn on their light stick to match the mood. Both groups’ movies broke movie theater records. “One Direction: This is Us” made $17 million in the box office on its opening weekend, according to Today. Overall, it made $68.5 million. “BTS: Permission to Dance” made $32.6 million in its first opening three days, according to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/bts-box-office-record-permission-to-dance-screenings-1235043553/">Billboard. </a>
