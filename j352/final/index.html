    <div class="intro">
        <h2>In the new age of social media, fandoms have evolved what streaming is to music. Before the digital age, people didn’t stream music for the chart numbers. If a song were doing good genuinely, it would come out on top of the charts. With the rise of fandoms and fangirls, there is new pressure on artists to have the most streams. Whether replaying a YouTube music video or having a strategic way to build streams on Spotify, fandoms have found a new way to get their artists recognized. Two popular bands who have redefined the way of streaming are One Direction and BTS. Directioners and ARMY are two of the largest fandoms in the music industry and they show love to their favorite artists in many ways. One of the ways is by streaming their songs to that they will break a record, which is a big accomplishment for the artist. Both fandoms have changed what streaming looks like. This website explores the differences between fandoms in streaming and how they do it</h2>
