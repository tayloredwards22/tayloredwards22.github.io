        <h1>Beyonce</h1>

        <p>
            Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, born September 4, 1981)is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.
            Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s
            as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the
            release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003), which featured the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one
            singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".
            <br>
            Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname "Queen Bey". She is
            one of the world's best-selling recording artists, having sold over 200 million records worldwide. Her
            success during the 2000s was recognized with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Top
            Certified Artist of the Decade as well as Billboard's Top Female Artist of the Decade. She is the first solo
            artist to have their first seven studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200.[11][12] Beyoncé's
            accolades include 28 Grammy Awards, 26 MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard
            Award in 2014), 24 NAACP Image Awards, 31 BET Awards, and 17 Soul Train Music Awards; all of which are more
            than any other singer. In 2014, Billboard named her the highest-earning black musician of all time, while in
            2020, she was included on Time's list of 100 women who defined the last century.

        <div class="Career">
            <h2>2022: Renaissance</h2>
            <p>On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms causing
                speculation that she would be releasing new music.[235] Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation
                via her nonprofit BeyGood's Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album.[236] On June
                15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled Renaissance. The album was
                released on July 29, 2022.[237][238] The first single from Renaissance, "Break My Soul", was released on
                June 20, 2022.[239] 
                <br>
                The song became Beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, and in doing
                so, Beyoncé joined Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve
                at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.[240] Upon release, Renaissance
                received universal acclaim from critics.[241] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200
                chart, and in doing so, Beyoncé became the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums
                debut at number one in the United States.[12]</p>

            <h2>Artistry</h2>
            <h3>Voice and musical style</h3>
            <p>Beyoncé's voice type is classified as Coloratura mezzo-soprano.[243][244] Jody Rosen highlights her tone
                and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling instruments
                in popular music".[245] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's
                Child.[246] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an
                insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting".[247] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced
                Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry,
                gospel and falsetto.[245] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The
                Washington Post saying she was "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or
                full-bore diva-roars."[248]
                <br>
                Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[249][250] pop[249][251] and hip hop[252] but she also incorporates
                soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as
                further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[242] While she almost exclusively
                releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of
                songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé
                was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[253]
