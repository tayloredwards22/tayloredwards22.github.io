    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces mascarpone</li>
        <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup turbinado sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons turbinado sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup espresso coffee</li>
        <li>7 ounces Savoiardi cookies</li>
        <li>2 ounces white chocolate shaved</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>PUMPKIN PIE SPICE</li>
        <li>4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground clove</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <h3>PUMPKIN PIE SPICE</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the above spices in a small dish and mix them well. Put the mixture through a small holes sleve to sift
            out any large or chunks of spices that did not separate well.</li>
        <li>Seal in a glass jar and use as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>PUMPKIN TIRAMISU</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the espresso coffee. Once done, pour it into a flat bowl, add 3 tablespoons of sugar. Stir to
            dissolve the sugar. Let it cool off.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile in a large bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine 1 ½ cups heavy
            cream, mascarpone, pumpkin, ½ cup sugar and the pumpkin pie spice. Beat starting slowly and increase to high
            speed until you reach a stiff whipped cream.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl beat remaining ½ cup heavy cream with 1 tablespoon sugar until stiff peaks are formed.</li>
        <li>Either use 6 ramekin or a medium rectangular dish. Dip the savoiardi in the coffee and line the bottom of
            the dish or ramekin with them. Top with a layer of the pumpkin-mascarpone cream. Top with another layer of
            savoiardi dipped in coffee and another layer of pumpkin mixture.</li>
        <li>Top each serving with a generous spoonful of whipped cream and shaved chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
